# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Objective

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Gameplay

Draw a grid of two parallel vertical lines intersecting with two parallel horizontal lines to form 9 boxes. One player (designated X) makes the first move by drawing that letter in any one of the 9 boxes; O follows by making the second move. The game can have only three outcomes: either player may emerge victorious by linking three of their letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or else the game ends in a “cat’s game” in which neither player connects three in a row. It’s best to rotate who is X and who is O so that the same player does not start each game.

## How to start the game

From a terminal or console run bin/main.rb
